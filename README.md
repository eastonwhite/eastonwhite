### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a quantitative marine ecologist who uses mathematical and statistical tools, coupled with experiments and field observations, to answer questions in ecology, conservation science, sustainability, and ecosystem management. Most of my work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. I am a new Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of New Hampshire. 

I currently conduct research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. My work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them. My current work is funded through a NSF grant focused on interdisiplinary approaches to study coupled natural-human systems with Madagascar fisheries as a case study:

A few things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on questions related to COVID-19 and the ocean, socio-ecological dynamics of fisheries in Madagascar, and how to improve species monitoring programs. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lots of things!
